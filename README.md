# odin-recipes
First project for the Odin Project. In this project, the aim is to create a website with a main page that shows different meals. Clicking on the meals will send you to seperate pages where you can see a picture, the ingredients and the recipe.

After completing the project, I have to say that it learned me a lot. I think the most important lesson was to just look things up if I wanted to make my site look a certain way.

Hell, by going to the first css class I found out that I was accidentily using in-line CSS in this project already. Might not be the best that I did not even notice but oh well. Exited to see what comes next!
